## Zitate

> "When you view the world as a series of outputs, you form opinions. But when you view the world as a series of systems, you form strategies." — Channing Allen

> "Your entire life runs on the software—the models—in your head. Why wouldn’t you obsess over optimizing it?" — Tim Urban

> Repeatedly ask whether you’re optimizing a cog in a machine instead of the machine itself. The higher the level you optimize at, typically the greater your ROI.
