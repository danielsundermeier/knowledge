> "I find a Buddhist framework, including the Secular Buddhist framework, to be very useful. It's based on the fact that nothing exists independently, that everything results from causes and conditions. You can't have a book without paper, a tree, rain, a cloud, etc. (example commonly used by Thich Nhat Hanh). Separateness is an illusion, and both Buddhist meditation practices and psychedelics foster awareness of this. We tend to misperceive ourselves as separate, static, and unitary, but really we are interconnected/inseparable, constantly changing, and a collection of elements (mental, physical). We're more like a process than an object, verbs instead of nouns. And that's true of both animate and inanimate things. This misperception is the source of our suffering, and experiential insights into this alleviates suffering. Kindness, compassion, and acting ethically all make sense in this framework since we are so inextricably interconnected with the world we live it, we are it. Intentionally causing harm doesn't make much sense in this perspective. This is fully compatible with a scientific worldview and does not require any supernatural beliefs, but it also provides a deep sense of meaning." - [Existential questions after a trip](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/pkr0kz/existential_questions_after_a_trip/)
