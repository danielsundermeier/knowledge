# Automatisierung

The automation designed based on a few specific principles:

- It should follow the same methodology as the human team members.
- It should use the same tools as the human team members.
- If another team member was doing administrative work on a machine or cluster (group of machines), the automation would step out of the way if asked, just like a human team member would.
- Like a good team member, if it got confused it would back off and ask other members of the team for help.
