[The Purpose Series (Part 2 of 3) - How Women are Attracted to Men with Attractive Purposes](https://www.woujo.com/blog/2019/12/15/the-purpose-series-part-2-of-3-how-women-are-attracted-to-men-with-attractive-purposes)

> "The most attractive aspect of a man to a woman is the emotional experience he enjoys."

> "To create an attractive emotional experience for yourself you must have confidence, which is the feeling that you can easily make progress towards your goals and that nothing can stand in your way. Confidence is the firepower you need to feel journey pleasure, and is essentially the feeling that you can get whatever you want, whenever you want, nothing can stop you, and that you are pursuing the best possible thing you can be pursuing"

> "Women can also pursue desirable purposes and feel journey pleasure, but their ability to do so is greatly hindered by the fact that they naturally feel much more anxiety than men, which means they naturally feel less confidence, which is why they prefer to vicariously feel a confident man’s journey pleasure, which is stronger and more consistent than hers"

> "The larger, more difficult, and more desirable the purposes you pursue, the more attractive you become."

> "To provide an attractive emotional experience for women, a man must create an attractive emotional experience for himself first, which requires him to insist on following his own purposes rather than the purposes of others."

> "It may sound counter-intuitive, but the more of your thoughts and emotions you dedicate to your own fun and following your own purposes, the more she will feel attracted because your “selfishness” causes you to enjoy a superior emotional experience, which will in turn allow her to vicariously experience a superior emotional experience. "

> "It is this solidity, immovability, and ability to draw boundaries to protect their emotional experience that women are seeking in men – they want to make sure the virtual reality game they have stepped into is “safe” and free from threats"

> "she must take meaningful steps to gain your validation, and only afterwards can you provide it to her"

> "A man feels true joy when his lower desires/purposes are satiated so he can focus his thoughts and emotions on venturing into the unknown to transcend his current reality and create a superior future reality for himself and others"

> "the most powerful thing you can provide her is positivity."

> "These meta-resources are much more important than any other resource, which is why women are not impressed with guys who buy them things – they don’t care that you can give them a banana, they want the man they feel can protect their current banana stash from thieves and get them infinite future bananas in the future."

> "In other words, figure out who she IS. Then, you excite her and build attraction by leading her out of the walled territory into the unknown in a controlled way."

> "The desire for the unknown is the source of all human innovation and creativity, but it can also lead to insanity and useless wandering down meaningless and dangerous paths."

> "Practically speaking, you can “venture into the unknown” by creating art, consuming art, learning stuff, overcoming your own limitations through self-improvement, solving problems in your life, being curious, growing in your career, or just walking through the world with an open mind and absorbing everything."

> "You fail to venture into the unknown by having boring, mundane conversations, by focusing on your lower pleasures like eating and video games, by letting her take the lead and take the conversation into boring and stupid territory, by doing mundane, repetitive things that she has done a million times, and by acting fearful and anxious."

> "If you feel the interaction dying or slowing down or becoming boring, it is your responsibility to do something to make it fun again."

> "If your only option is to leave her, it is better to do that than to suffer through a shitty emotional experience; once she sees that you are willing to defend your emotional experience at all costs, she will be more attracted to you, more willing to emotionally invest in you, and more willing to let you take the lead the next time you come back and give her a second chance."

> "The Ultimate Transcendent Purpose is the creation of a future reality that is infinitely better than the current reality in every way. It is an impossible goal, which means that you will never run out of journey pleasure as you pursue it.  "

> "Because his desires are ordered correctly and he can fulfill them whenever he wants, the alpha male consistently feels a calm, disinterested, almost humorous, satiation and contentment about most things, the same way you feel most of the time about cheeseburgers. The only desire of the alpha male that is not satiated is the feeling of venturing into the unknown, which is fine, because venturing into the unknown is our highest purpose. "

> "„Creepiness” is just emotional over-investment in a particular emotion, and you over-invest in something when you place it in the wrong place in the hierarchy of your emotional experience."

> "if you feel a conversation dying you should confidently make some excuse and leave, and then come back later."

> "your main purpose when interacting with women should be to find somebody who will help you pursue your purposes and enhance your emotional experience, whatever those may be."

> "The deeper, the better. Human beings naturally have a strong desire to discuss deep subjects: God, spirituality, relationships, their beliefs about the universe, their goals for life, their passions, their hatreds, etc... These subjects are "deep" because they are emotionally important to people and difficult to completely figure out, so there is a ton of unknown to explore."

> "The most important skill when interacting with women is the ability to read your audience, figure out what they care about, and tailor the emotional experience in a way that will maximally stimulate their emotions."

> "You feel confidence when 1) you feel like you are pursuing the best goal you could be pursuing, and 2) you feel you can defeat any threats or challenges on the way to the goal. Confidence is the feeling that you can get whatever you want, whenever you want.they want a guy who FEELS like he can do whatever he wants whenever he wants."

> "Or to be more specific, women want to find a man whose subconscious mind feels like there is a clear path to anything he could possibly want, and when women find that man they want to vicariously experience his emotions."

> "But if you change your purpose to “approach this woman and have a brief conversation” your subconscious mind may calculate that the possibility that this purpose is likely to be successful is relatively high, so it will energize you to go for it"

> "it is not the money that women want most, but the feeling of moving towards a better future."

> "The solution to this dilemma is that you must not only venture into the unknown, but you must also yourself feel like the unknown to her."
