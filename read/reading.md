[The Alluring City](https://wrathofgnon.substack.com/p/the-alluring-city)

> "What if we were to try and build a scene, or a place (forget about what—a street plan or a housing project or a gas station or a public stair etc.—for a little while), that held as much allure as possible? It would probably use natural materials—because these age gracefully—and incorporate a large dollop of the natural—whether a roofline that attracts the eye to the naked sky and frames it, or an old woman's humble window-box of roses—, it would be a combination of the public and the private, the commercial and the official. It would speak to us, and it would say things like “linger a little if you please” (or: to here but no further, see but don't touch, rest a while but don't impose yourself, etc.), it would be both a room to arrive into and an intriguing way out, both shelter for repose and a launching point for further exploration or even adventure. An alluring place would be both satisfying to body and soul, and appetite inducing at the same time."

> "Instead, we should raise our clean energy production ambitions. We don’t want to replace 100% of our current dirty energy — we want to generate vastly more energy than we are currently using and make it zero carbon."
