[The Irresistible Future](https://kk.org/thetechnium/the-irresistible-future/)

> "A guy appears at your door. He has a glowing sphere in his hand. He says he is from the future and will transport you 500 years into that future. You want to know what that future world is like. What does he have to say in order for you to get in? What is the future equivalent of “all the free food you can eat”?"

> "But no matter how much intelligence you have, this thinkism alone won’t solve problems by itself. Intelligence has to be combined with imagination, perseverance, intuition, and large quantities of data, experience, and conext to really be useful. It’s these other qualities that our humanness can supply."

[The Many Worlds of Enough](https://moretothat.com/the-many-worlds-of-enough/)

> "Ambition morphs into greed when you stop listening to your inner compass, and start paying attention to what your actions may do for external things like your reputation."

> "Enough is what remains when you remove these desires for approval or praise."

> "You must self-adjust your definition of enough, instead of having it forced upon you. Wisdom is in self-correction, while misery is in coerced correction."
