> "The first rule of a happy life is low expectations. If you have unrealistic expectations you’re going to be miserable your whole life. You want to have reasonable expectations and take life’s results good and bad as they happen with a certain amount of stoicism."

> "It’s a world that demands you become comfortable with a lot of things not working, lots of things failing, and constant disappointment, because “success” means you tried ten things and eight of them fail miserably but two change your life."

> "The key part is that low expectations and accepting frequent losses increase the odds of sticking around long enough to eventually be right enough to make up for it, and then some."

> "Low expectations don’t make you depressed – they do the opposite, making little gains feel amazing while bad news feels normal."

> "But imagine the tragedy of unbelievable progress throughout your life and enjoying none of it because you expected all of it."
